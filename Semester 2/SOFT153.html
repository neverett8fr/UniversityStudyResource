    <p/>Distributivity? -- The Distributive Law says that multiplying a number by a group of numbers added together is the same as doing each multiplication separately. Example: 3 × (2 + 4) = 3×2 + 3×4.
    <p/>Simple factoring -- common factoring, y(x + x) = 2xy -- multiplying fractions -- manipulating fractions e.g. (3/4) * (5/6) = 15/24

    <p/>*Polynomials research what they are
    <p/>
    <p/>Polynomial - mix of natural and real numbers, etc.??
    <p/>
    <p/>**Asymptotic behaviour
    <p/>
    <p/>**polynomial Functions
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>**searching -- binary searching, linear searching, etc.
    <p/>research this -- actually quite interesting
    <p/>research their speeds and efficiency - essay basically again
    <p/>polynomial functions, etc.
    <p/>*just read the course online, easy.
    <p/>
    <p/>**derivatives, integration, etc.
    <p/>**Rayleigh Curve research
    <p/>**interpolation, extrapolation
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>---------------------------------------
    <p/>
    <p/>Extrapolation and Interpolation#
    <p/>
    <p/>Extrapolation - process of extending a given set of data points with new data points (estimating based on past data)
    <p/>extra - add more on end or before start -- assumes data will continue to follow trend
    <p/>Interpolation - within the data points
    <p/>
    <p/>Fancy graphs and trees
    <p/>Graph is a set of nodes - generally
    <p/>vertices - corner points
    <p/>edges - lines
    <p/>
    <p/>**Monte Carlo Simulation --?? lookup
    <p/>
    <p/>random numbers-
    <p/>normally generate a real number between 1 and 0 with all values between 0 and 1 being equally likely
    <p/>if x:= random then:
    <p/>p(0 < x < 1) = 1
    <p/>p(0 < x < 0.5) = 0.5
    <p/>p(0.2 < x < 0.64) = 0.44

    <p/>
    <p/>Venn Diagrams -- Probability
    <p/>
    <p/>probability for or == p(a) + p(b) - p(a and b) --- a and b are different circles within the diagram
    <p/>this is different for mutually exclusive events
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>two events cannot happen together if they are mutually exclusive
    <p/>p(a and b) = 0
    <p/>p(a or b) = p(a) + p(b)
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>**lookup determining mutual exclusivity
    <p/>
    <p/>Exhaustiveness
    <p/>events are exhaustive if p(a or b or ... or z) = 1
    <p/>// it is certain that at least one event a ... z will occur#
    <p/>exhaustive and mutually exclusive -- then certain only one event will occur
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>Negation
    <p/>1 = p(a) + p(a')
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>Conditional Probability -- p(a or b) = p(a) given p(b)
    <p/>p(a or b) = p(a and b) / p(b)

    <p/>**Composite Key
    <p/>--A composite key is a combination of two or more
    <p/>columns in a table that can be used to
    <p/>uniquely identify each row in the table when
    <p/>the columns are combined uniqueness is guaranteed,
    <p/>but when it taken individually it does not guarantee
    <p/>uniqueness.
    <p/>
    <p/>Example: OrderID and ProductID: {OrderID, ProductID}
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>What is the difference between a composite key,
    <p/>primary key and foreign key? ... A primary key is
    <p/>defined as a key or database column which uniquely
    <p/>identifies each row in a database table.
    <p/>A composite key is a set of more than one key that,
    <p/>together, uniquely identifies each record
    <p/>
    <p/>??** Compound Key **?? -- research the types of keys
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>Properties of Tables--
    <p/>- No two rows are the same
    <p/>- The order of rows is not significant
    <p/>- The order of columns is not significant
    <p/>- each column has a unique name
    <p/>- all attributes are atomic (cannot be sub-divided)
    <p/>- All non-key attributes are dependent on the key,
    <p/>the whole key and nothing but the key
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>-- Database Normalisation
    <p/>- "Normal Forms" ** Lookup ??
    <p/>- Follow sequentially , 1st, 2nd, 3rd
    <p/>- each of the columns should contain one value
    <p/>(no more) and there should be no repeating groups
    <p/>- Can we figure out "any of the values in a row" from
    <p/>just part of the composite key
    <p/>** this was asking if any value is present in other,
    <p/>table, stopping duplication -- e.g. cource code link to
    <p/>another table with course name and teacher, etc.
    <p/>*** lookup from slide i think it was
    <p/>asking if any attribute can be determined from other
    <p/>attribute in the table
    <p/>- Can we figure out "any of the values in a row" from
    <p/>any of the other values in the same row
    <p/>

    <p/>--------------------------
    <p/>- Flow Diagram Stuff Pretty easy
    <p/>- Pseudocode too
    <p/>
    <p/>- Flow
    <p/>-- Rectangle = General Statement
    <p/>-- Rhombus / slanted = Input / Output
    <p/>-- Diamond = Conditional Branching = If statements
    <p/>-- Oval = Start / Stop
    <p/>
    <p/>-- Drawback
    <p/>--- Only usable for small size programs
    <p/>--- they do not well support for / while loops / or recursion
    <p/>--- they do lead to an uncontrolled use of "goto"
    <p/>--- this results in hard to read / "Spaghetti Code"
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>- Structured Programming
    <p/>-- Break problems into pieces according to the problem structure
    <p/>-- break pieces into smaller pieces, etc.
    <p/>-- don't refer to specific language elements early
    <p/>-- pieces interact via "interfaces" but are otherwise independent
    <p/>-- project - modules - functions - fragments
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>- Structogram / Nassi Shneiderman Diagrams
    <p/>-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram
    <p/>-- Graphical representation for Structured programming
    <p/>
    <p/>-- Structogram: Process
    <p/>--- Rectangle / Square
    <p/>--- can contain a single statement or a bigger functional block depending on the resolution
    <p/>--- flow enters on the top and exits on the bottom of the element
    <p/>
    <p/>-- Structogram: Decision
    <p/>--- Triangle followed by 2 triangles with T or F and then a process block
    <p/>--- if condition x is true, follow true side
    <p/>
    <p/>-- Structogram:
    <p/>--- Square inside square: for - & while loop
    <p/>--- Inside Square at bottom
    <p/>---- process block embedded in loop where the loops exit condition is evaluated at the beginning
    <p/>--- Inside Square at top: do - while loop
    <p/>---- process block embedded in loop where the loops exit condition is evaluated at the end - do while loop, repeat until loop
    <p/>
    <p/>-- structogram: Break / Continue
    <p/>--- Similar for for- and while loops
    <p/>--- look at powerpoint Soft153 - 01b
    <p/>
    <p/>-- structogram: Logic Example
    <p/>--- look at powerpoint Soft153 - 01b
    <p/>--- e.g. ¬, ?, etc.
    <p/>
    <p/>-- Structogram: Nested Loops
    <p/>--- Loop within loop
    <p/>--- Matric Multiplication?
    <p/>--- See powerpoint Soft153 - 01b
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>- Prime Numbers - if divisible by only itself and 1 and no number inbetween it is prime
    <p/>
    <p/>
    <p/>- An idea of structograms (Nassi/Shneiderman diagrams) as a first step to develop structured code
    <p/>- Flow Diagrams - as an alternative to structograms that, however, does not support structured programming
